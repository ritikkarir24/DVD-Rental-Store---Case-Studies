# DVD Rental Store 

This project contains dataset regarding sales made in the two different stores, which is being extracted from "Sakila Database" and storing it in a comma seperated file ( CSV ).
 


## Prerequisite
You need to have latest version of Python3 installed on your device
or you could upload the .ipynb file in your "Jupyter Ntebook" or on "Google Collab" 

Libraries needed : 
* numpy 
* pandas
* matplotlib
## Code Explanation
   <img src="Code snippets/carbon.png" alt="sql query" width = 800/>
   
* We are reading the SQL query by using "pd.read_sql()" which takes two arguments: first being an empty string ('') and second being a list of comma-separated fields to be read into the dataframe.
The next step is to create a new column called customer_lastname which will contain last names for customers who rented films from this store on this date and time period.

* Next, another new column called store will contain information about what store they rented their film from as well as city where they live and address where they rented their film at on this day/time period/day of week/month etc etc etc...

* Finally, there are two more columns added: one for film title and another for rental duration which contains how long it took them to rent their movie out of all movies available in that particular store during that day or time period or whatever you want it to be!

* The code reads the rentals from Sakila database and creates a new pandas dataframe. And makes "rental_id" as index column.

**You wil understand the rest of the code, because its done in a unique fashion**
